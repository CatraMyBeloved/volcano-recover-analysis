# Volcanic Recovery Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Analysis of vegetation recovery patterns following volcanic eruptions using satellite imagery and NDVI analysis.

## Project Goals
- Track vegetation recovery after volcanic eruptions
- Map lava flow extent using vegetation analysis
- Compare recovery patterns in different impact zones
- Document recovery processes using satellite data

## Project Status
Currently in preparation phase:
- [x] Initial research completed
- [x] Data access accounts created
- [ ] Eruption selection pending
- [ ] Data gathering not started
